### While Playing

The UI shows the current character in yellow color with a blinking bar beneath it.
All the correctly typed characters will be in green color and the wrong ones will be in red.

### Stat Bar

You can see your stats live while playing and also at the end of 60-seconds.

The JavaScript program calculate the **WPM** at two times. Once at every keydown event and second time at the end of the game.
